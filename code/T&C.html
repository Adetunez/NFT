                <h1>1. Terms & Conditions</h1>
                <p>Pepper Armageddon is a collection of digital artworks (NFTs) running on the Solana network. This website is only an interface allowing participants to exchange digital collectibles. Users are entirely responsible for the safety and management of their own private Solana wallets and validating all transactions and contracts generated by this website before approval. Furthermore, as the Pepper Armageddon smart contract runs on the Solana network, there is no ability to undo, reverse, or restore any transactions.</p>
                <p>Solana requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the Solana network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Solana network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction.</p>
                <p>This website and its connected services are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranty of any kind. By using this website you are accepting sole responsibility for any and all transactions involving Pepper Armageddon digital collectibles.</p>
